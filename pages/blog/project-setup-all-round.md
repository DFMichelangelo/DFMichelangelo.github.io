Developing a new project is exciting: starting from scrath with the freedom of creating something you, along with the cumulated experience of the previous experiment makes you want to rush into the code as fast as you can.

In corporations, it mainly consists in delivering business value in the minumum amount of time, especially n the financial services sector where this phenomenom is even more predominant: PnL is not growing enough, clients are willing to trade, investors want their money back etc.

Creating value in short time becomes cucial and _show something_ are the motivations the lead to finish as fast as possible, compromising in the long term.

Working with low quality standards is not only a threat for the project itself, but might impact real aspects of the business: in Electronic Trading, autohedgers manage orders with a latency sometimes lower than 2 milliseconds and not having full control of what's happening might lead to huge losses ([Knight Capital 440 million loss case](https://archive.nytimes.com/dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/08/02/knight-capital-says-trading-mishap-cost-it-440-million/) is a clear example of the consequences of what happens to the bests when something is overlooked).
