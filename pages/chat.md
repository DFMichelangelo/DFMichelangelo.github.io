<!-- [ITA Italian](/chat-it) -->

If you're curious about delving into electronic trading but feel uncertain about taking the first step, or if you're already involved and have questions about your journey, I would be delighted to chat with you and share my experiences and insights to help you find your way.

## Quick Chat

I want to keep the conversation easy, open, and accessible. Come prepared with some initial research and questions in mind. I am looking forward have a short while meaningful chat with you.

## Consultancy

If there is the need to tackle more complex questions or in-depth discussions that may require a longer time frame. If needed, I'm happy to do an hour consultancy call to help.
