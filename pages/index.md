I am Michelangelo De Francesco, an eRates Quantitative Research Analyst.

Working at [<span i-mdi:bank-outline/> Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation](https://www.smbcgroup.com/) in London.<br>

My area of expertise is eTrading with a particular focus on eFX and eRates: during my career I had the opportunity to work on pricing and autohedging various financial instruments for EMEA and US markets for market making purposes.

Outside of programming and finance, I enjoy going to the gym and cooking.
